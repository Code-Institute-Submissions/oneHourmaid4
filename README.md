# oneHourmaid
My Second Milestone Project - Interactive Frontend Development

oneHourmaid is a cleaning app designed to have a cleaner at your door with in minutes. You can select from a #Basic Clean which consists of a simple house tidy up, washing dishes, vacuuming throughout etc. A #Deep Clean, which is more based around cleaning in those hard to reach areas i.e behind Refriderators, Cookers, Dish Washers. But also includes carpet cleaning and wooden/laminant floor polishing. The final option is Moving In/Out, here you can book a cleaner to deep clean either the house you're moving in to or the house you are moving out from.

## UX
oneHourmaid was designed for working people or families that may not have the time to focus on basic house chores. oneHourmaid can take care of all your in home cleaning needs quickly and effeciently. The app was made to be simple and straightforward as to remain relevant amongst all audiences.
